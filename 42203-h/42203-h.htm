<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little Dutch cousins have much in
common with little American cousins, not so
much perhaps with respect to present-day institutions
and manners and customs, as with
the survivals and traditions of other days, when
the Dutch played so important a part in the
founding of the new America.</p>

<p>It was from Holland, too, from the little
port of Delfshaven, that the Pilgrim Fathers
first set sail for the New World, and by this
fact alone Holland and America are bound together
by another very strong link, though this
time it was of English forging.</p>

<p>No European country, save England, has
the interest for the American reader or traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
that has "the little land of dikes and windmills,"
and there are many young Americans
already familiar with the ways of their cousins
from over the seas from the very fact that so
many of them come to Holland to visit its
fine picture-galleries, its famous and historic
buildings, its tulip-gardens, and its picturesque
streets and canals, which make it a paradise for
artists.</p>

<p>Our little Dutch cousins mingle gladly with
their little American cousins, and the ties that
bind make a bond which is, and always has
been, inseverable.</p>

<h2>Our Little Dutch Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PIETER AND WILHELMINA</div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> do you think of a country where
you can pick up sugar-plums along the road?
Well, this was just what Pieter and Wilhelmina
were going to do as, hand in hand, they
flew up the road as fast as their little wooden
shoes would let them, to meet a carriage which
was rapidly approaching. Behind the carriage
ran a crowd of children, laughing and tumbling
over each other.</p>

<p>"Oh! they are throwing the 'suikers' now;
run faster, Wilhelmina," panted Pieter; and,
sure enough, as the carriage went by, a shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of candies fell all about them. One piece
dropped right in Wilhelmina's mouth, which
of course was open, because she had been running
so hard. But there was no time to laugh,
as the children were all scrambling hard to
pick up the sweets. Then they tried to catch
up with the carriage again, but it was nearly
out of sight by this time, and so one by one
the young folk stopped to count up their
gains, and compare them with one another.</p>

<p>This was a wedding-party returning from
church. In the carriage sat the bride and
groom. The carriage sat high up on its two
great wheels, and was gaudily painted and gaily
decked with flowers and ribbons.</p>

<p>Pieter and Wilhelmina had been on the
lookout for this bridal party with more than
usual interest, for two relatives of the bride
had come to their mother a few days before to
invite her to the wedding ceremony, and the
children thought these young men had looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
very fine in their best clothes, with flowers
stuck in the sides of their caps.</p>

<p>The bride had her arms full of candies, and,
as was the custom, she threw them out to the
children as they drove along. The little Dutch
children call these candies "suikers." As you
may imagine, this is a great treat for them,
and accordingly the children of Holland take
more of an interest in weddings than do the
children of other countries.</p>

<p>"Put all the 'suikers' in my apron, Pieter,"
said Wilhelmina, "and let us go and show
them to the mother," and the children quickly
ran back home.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina and Pieter were twins, so it
does not matter whether we say Wilhelmina
or Pieter first, and they looked so much alike
that when they stood together in the high
grass by the side of the canal which ran in
front of their home, it was hard to tell one
from the other if it had not been for Pieter's cap.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>They both had round, rosy faces, and round,
blue eyes, and yellow hair, only you would not
know that Wilhelmina had any hair at all, for
it was completely hidden by her cap. They
both wore little wooden shoes, and it was a
marvel how fast they could run in them, for
they seem to be on the point of dropping off
most of the time, but, strange to say, they
never do.</p>

<p>Holland is the dearest little wee country in
the world. Uncle Sam could put it in his vest
pocket. It looks like a country just made to
play in. Its houses are so small and trim, all
set about with neat little gardens and trees,
which look as if they had been cut out of
wood, like the trees in the "Noah's arks."
There are little canals and little bridges everywhere,
and little towns scattered here and there
all over the broad, flat country. You could
go to all of the principal cities of this little land
in one day, and you can stand in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
church towers and see over half the country at
a glance. The only things that look big are
the windmills.</p>

<p>What do you think of a garden gate without
any fence? But this is just the sort of a gate
that the twins entered when they arrived home.
Instead of a fence there was a small canal which
divided the garden from the road, and of course
the gate was in the middle of a small bridge,
otherwise how could they have got across the
canal?</p>

<p>At the front door they both left their shoes
on the steps outside, for Dutch people never
think of bringing their dirty shoes into the
house. Then they opened only half of the
front door and went in. Many Dutch doors are
made in two parts, the upper half remaining
open most of the time, like a window, while
the lower half is closed like an ordinary door.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, see what a lot of 'suikers'
the bride threw to us," said Wilhelmina, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
up to Mevrouw Joost, who was bustling
about the china cupboard in the living-room.</p>

<p>"And she was such a pretty bride, too, with
a lovely dress; and there were flowers twined
all about the carriage, and a wreath on the
horse's head, and long streamers of white ribbon
wound around the whip," she continued
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"And we got more 'suikers' than any one
else," put in Pieter.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a gay party. I saw them pass
by the house," said Mevrouw Joost, smilingly,
as she ate a "suiker."</p>

<p>"Baby Jan must have one too," said Wilhelmina,
as she went over to play with the
baby who was kicking and crowing in his great
carved cradle near the window. Jan was the
household pet, and there had been a great celebration
when he was a week old.</p>

<p>All the friends of the Joost family were invited
to come and see the baby, a red pincushion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
having been hung out beside the front
door to let everybody know that there was a new
baby boy within. When the guests arrived,
they were given rusks to eat, a kind of sweet
bread, covered with aniseed and sugar, called
"muisjes," which really means "mice." Before,
when the friends had come to pay their
respects to Wilhelmina and Pieter, there had
been two kinds of "muisjes." One had a sort
of smooth white icing on the top, and that was
Wilhelmina's, while Pieter's rusks had lumps
of sugar sticking up all over them.</p>

<p>The Dutch are the neatest people in the
world. They are always washing and rubbing
and dusting things, and one could no more find
a spider's web in Mevrouw Joost's home than
they could a white elephant.</p>

<p>The floor of the living-room was made of
tiny red bricks, waxed and polished until they
shone like glass. There was much heavy oak
furniture, beautifully carved; a big round table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
stood in the centre, and on one side was a great
dresser or sideboard. The chairs were solid
and big, with high backs and straw seats, and
some of them were painted dark green, with
curious little pictures and decorations also
painted on them.</p>

<p>One end of the square room was filled by
what looked like two big cupboards with heavy
green curtains hanging in front of them, but
one of the curtains was drawn partly back and
one could see that they were two great beds
instead, built into the wall just like cupboards.
These were the "show-beds," and were not for
constant use, but mostly for ornament.</p>

<p>Mevrouw Joost was very proud of these
beds and kept them always made up with her
very finest linen, trimmed with rich lace, and her
most brilliantly coloured embroidered coverlids,
the whole being piled so high that the
beds nearly reached the ceiling. There was
barely enough room on top for the two enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
eider-down pillows, with gay covers and
lace ruffles, which lay on each of the beds and
completed their furnishings.</p>

<p>Some Dutch houses have a separate room for
these "show-beds," which we should call a parlour,
but Mevrouw Joost had her "show-beds"
where she could enjoy their magnificence every
day.</p>

<p>She had her "show-room," too, but kept it
most beautifully and tightly closed up, so that
not a ray of light or a speck of dirt could come
in, for it was only used on some great occasion.</p>

<p>Another side of the living-room was nearly
filled by the huge fireplace, covered with square,
blue Delft tiles, on each of which was a picture
which told a story from the Bible. The
ceiling was crossed with great beams of wood,
and a wainscoting of wood went all around
the room.</p>

<p>On the sideboard, on the shelves above the
beds, and over the mantel were fine pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
rare old Delft china, which is a beautiful deep
blue. It is very rare now, and much prized
by the Dutch Mevrouws. There was also a
quantity of copper and brass jugs and pewter
platters, while by the fireplace hung a big brass
warming-pan, which is a great pan with a cover
and a long handle. On a cold and damp winter's
night Mevrouw Joost filled it with
red-hot coals, and warmed the household
beds by slipping it in and out between the
sheets.</p>

<p>There were spotless white curtains at the
tiny windows, and everything shone under the
housewife's brisk rubbings.</p>

<p>Back of the sitting-room was the kitchen,
with another big fireplace, in which was set
the cooking-stove. Around the walls were
many bright copper pans and pots of all
kinds.</p>

<p>There were big brass jugs to hold milk, and
kegs with brass hoops in which they stow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
away their butter. The Dutch are so fond of
polishing things that they put brass on everything,
it would seem, just for the joy of rubbing
it afterward.</p>

<p>Many of the commoner things were made
beautiful as well. The knife-handles were
carved, and on many of the brass bowls and
platters were graceful patterns. One would
see a little cow carved on the big wooden
butter-spoon, or a tiny windmill on the handle
of a fork, while the great churn that stood in
the corner of the kitchen had gay pictures
painted upon it. From this you may judge
what a pleasant and attractive room Mevrouw
Joost's kitchen was.</p>

<p>"Why are you putting out all the best
china and the pretty silver spoons, mother?"
asked Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>"The father is showing a visitor through
the tulip-gardens. It is the great merchant,
Mynheer Van der Veer, from Amsterdam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
He has come to buy some of the choice plants,
for he says truly there are no tulips in all
Holland as fine as ours," and the good lady
drew herself up with a pardonable pride, as
she polished the big silver coffee-pot, which
already shone so Wilhelmina might see her
face in it like a mirror.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, mother?" asked Wilhelmina.
She would have liked nothing better
than to handle the dainty cups and saucers,
but she knew well that her mother would not
trust this rare old china to any hands but her
own, for these cups and saucers had been
handed down through many generations of
her family, as had the quaint silver spoons
with the long twisted handles, at the end of
which were little windmills, ships, lions, and
the like, all in silver.</p>

<p>"No, no, little one, you are only in the
way; go out into the garden and tell your
father not to delay too long or our guest will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
drink cold coffee," said Mevrouw, bustling
about more than ever.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina was eager enough to see the
great Mynheer, so she joined Pieter, who had
already slipped out, and together they went
toward the bulb-gardens, where Mynheer and
their father were looking over the wonderful
tulips.</p>

<p>Pieter and Wilhelmina lived in a quaint
little house of one story only, built of very
small red brick, with a roof of bright red tiles.
The window-frames were painted white, and
the window-blinds a bright blue, while the
front door was bright green. There was a little
garden in front, and the paths all followed
tiny canals, which were spanned here and
there by small bridges. In one corner was a
pond, on which floated little toy ducks and
fish, and it was great fun for the children to
wind up the clockwork inside of these curious
toys, and watch them move about as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
were alive. But on this afternoon the twins
were thinking of other things, and kept on to
the bulb-gardens. Here was a lovely sight,&mdash;acres
and acres of nothing but tulips of all
colours, and hyacinths, and other bulbs which
Mynheer Joost grew to send to the big flower
markets of Holland and other countries as
well; for, as Mevrouw Joost had said, their
tulips were famous the world over. Mynheer
Joost took great pains with his bulbs, and was
able to grow many varieties which could not
be obtained elsewhere.</p>

<p>The tulip is really the national flower of
Holland, so the Dutch (as the people of
Holland are called) are very fond of them,
and you see more beautiful varieties here than
anywhere else. Every Dutchman plants tulips
in his garden, and there is a great rivalry between
neighbours as to who can produce the
most startling varieties in size and colour.</p>

<p>Pieter and Wilhelmina were never tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hearing their father tell of the time all Holland
went almost crazy over tulips. This was nearly
three hundred years ago, after the tulip had just
been brought to Holland, and was a much
rarer flower than it is to-day. It got to be
the fashion for every one to raise tulips, and
they sold for large sums of money. Several
thousands of "guldens" (a "gulden" is the
chief Dutch coin) were paid for a single bulb.
People sold their houses and lands to buy
tulips, which they were able to sell again at a
great profit. Everybody went wild over these
beautiful flowers, rich and poor alike, men,
women, and children. Everybody bought
and sold tulips, and nobody thought or talked
about anything but the price of tulips. At
last the Dutch government put a stop to this
nonsense, and down tumbled the prices of
tulips.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the Dutch love for the
flower still continued, and to-day one may see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
these great fields of tulips and hyacinths and
other bulb-plants covering miles and miles of
the surface of Holland, just as do wheat-fields
in other lands.</p>

<p>There is a large and continually growing
trade in these plants going on all over Holland,
and Mynheer Joost was always able to
sell his plants for as big a price as any others
in the market. The principal tulip-gardens
are in the vicinities of the cities of Leyden and
Haarlem, and from where Wilhelmina and
Pieter now stood, in the midst of their father's
tulip-beds, they could see the tower of the
Groote Kerk, or Great Church, of Haarlem.</p>

<p>Mynheer Joost sold a very rare variety,
which only he knew how to grow, and which
was named the "Joost;" it was almost
pure black, with only a tiny red tip on each
petal. It was the pride of his heart, and he
often told the children that he hoped some
day to be able to turn it into a pure black one;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and then what a fortune it would bring them
all! So Pieter and Wilhelmina watched its
growth almost as carefully as did their father.</p>

<p>"There is Mynheer and the father now,
looking at the 'great tulip,'" said Pieter. This
was the way they always spoke of this wonderful
plant.</p>

<p>But Wilhelmina suddenly grew shy at the
sight of the great man. "Come, let us hide,"
she said, and she tried to draw Pieter behind
one of the large glass houses, in which were
kept many of the rarer plants. But Pieter
wanted to see Mynheer Van der Veer, the
well-known merchant who owned so many big
warehouses in Amsterdam, and also a tall, fine
house on one of the "grachten" of that city,
which is the name given to the canals.</p>

<p>Mynheer was a portly old gentleman, and
was dressed much as would be a merchant in
any great city; in a black suit and a silk hat,
for the wealthy people of the big cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Holland do not wear to-day the picturesque
costumes of the country people. It is only
in the country and small towns that one sees
the quaint dress which often has changed but
little from what it was hundreds of years ago.
But the Joost family, like many another in
the country, were very proud of their old-time
dress, and would not have changed it for
a modern costume for anything, and though
Mynheer Joost was also a wealthy man, he
was dressed in the same kind of clothes as
those worn by his father and grandfather before
him. He had on big, baggy trousers of
dark blue velvet, coming only to the knee,
and fastened at the waist with a great silver
buckle; a tight-fitting vest or coat, with two
rows of big silver buttons down the front, and
around his neck was a gay-coloured handkerchief.
On his head was a curious high cap,
and on his feet the big wooden shoes, nicely
whitened.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of the men were smoking big cigars,
for the Dutch are great smokers, and are never
without a pipe or cigar.</p>

<p>Mynheer Van der Veer had finished selecting
his tulips, and now caught sight of the
twins, who were standing shyly together, holding
hands as usual, behind a mass of crimson
and yellow tulips.</p>

<p>"Aha! these are your two young ones, my
friend; they, too, are sturdy young plants.</p>

<p>"You look like one of your father's finest
pink tulips, little one," he continued, patting
Wilhelmina's pink cheeks.</p>

<p>You might not think it was a compliment
to be called a tulip, but you must not forget
what a high regard the Dutch have for these
flowers. So Wilhelmina knew that she was
receiving a great compliment, and grew pinker
than ever, and entirely forgot the message
which her mother had given her.</p>

<p>"And, Pieter, some day I suppose that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
will be growing rare tulips like your father,"
said Mynheer, peering at the lad over the
rims of his glasses.</p>

<p>"Pieter helps me greatly now, out of school
hours, and Wilhelmina can pack blossoms for
the market as well as our oldest gardener," said
Mynheer Joost, who thought that there were
no children in Holland the equal of his twins.
"But you must let the Vrouw give you some
of her cakes and coffee before you leave, Mynheer,"
he continued as he led the way back to
the house.</p>

<p>The Dutch are very hospitable, and are
never so happy as when they are giving their
visitors nice things to eat and drink, and it
would be considered very rude to refuse any
of these good things; but then nobody wants
to.</p>

<p>Mynheer Van der Veer was soon seated at
the big oak table, which was covered with a
linen cloth finely embroidered, and edged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a deep ruffle of lace. On it were the plates
of Delftware filled with many kinds of cakes
and sweet biscuits, which the Dutch call "koejes;"
besides, there were delicious sweet rusks,
which Mevrouw Joost brought hot from the
oven. Then she poured the hot water on to
the coffee from a copper kettle which stood on
a high copper stand by the side of the table.
The silver coffee-pot itself stood on a porcelain
stand at one end of the table, and under
this stand was a tiny flame burning from an
alcohol-lamp in order to keep the coffee warm.</p>

<p>There was no better coffee to be had in all
Holland than Mevrouw Joost's, and how
good it tasted, to be sure, out of the dainty
china cups,&mdash;real china, for they had been
brought from the Far East by a great-uncle of
the Joosts who had engaged in the trade with
China at the time when there were nothing but
sailing ships on the seas. After the coffee
came brandied cherries, served in little glasses.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the young people come to Amsterdam
again, Mynheer Joost, you must bring
them to see me," said the merchant, "and
perhaps the young man will want to leave even
his tulips when he sees what is in the big warehouses."</p>

<p>The twins' eyes shone and they pinched
each other with delight at the mere thought
of a visit to the wonderful city house of the
great merchant in wealthy Amsterdam, the
largest city in their country.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE AMERICAN COUSIN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> one who saw the twins on their way to
school one morning soon after the visit of
Mynheer Van der Veer would know that
something unusual had happened, for they
were both talking away at once, in a most excited
manner. Little Dutch children are usually
very quiet, when compared to the children
of most other countries, though they are full
of fun, in a quiet sort of a way, when they
want to be.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pieter," Wilhelmina was saying, "to
think that we have a cousin coming to see us
from across the seas!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if he can talk Dutch; if he can't
we will have to speak English, so you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
better see to it that you have a better English
lesson than you did yesterday," said Pieter,
who was rather vain of his own English.</p>

<p>There is nothing strange in hearing little
Dutch children speak English, French, or
German, for they are taught all three languages
in their schools; and even very little children
can say some words of English or German.</p>

<p>"It is well for you to talk," said Wilhelmina,
feeling hurt. "English is not hard for
you to learn; as for me, I can learn my German
lesson in half the time that you can."</p>

<p>"Ah well! the German is more like our
own Dutch language," said Pieter, soothingly,
for the twins were never "at outs" for long at
a time. "You will soon learn English from
our new cousin from America. Listen! there
is the school-bell ringing now," and away they
clattered in their wooden shoes to the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Yesterday there had been a solemn meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the Joost home. You must know that it
was an important occasion, because they all
met in the "show-room." The "domine"
(as the Dutch call their clergymen) had been
invited, and the schoolmaster, too, and they
all sat around and sipped brandied cherries and
coffee, the men puffing away on their long
pipes, while Mynheer Joost read aloud to them
a letter. It was from a distant relative of the
Joost family who lived in New York City.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="girl and mother in front of fire" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;HOW OLD IS COUSIN THEODORE, MOTHER?&#39; ASKED
WILHELMINA&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>You know, of course, that the Dutch were
among the first to settle in America, and in the
present great city of New York. In those early
days a great-great-grand-uncle of Mynheer
Joost had gone to the island of Manhattan,
and made his home, and now one of his descendants,
a Mr. Sturteveldt, who was a merchant
in New York City, was anxious to learn
something about his family in Holland. He
had heard of Mynheer Joost through a friend
of his who was fond of flowers, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
once come to Holland to buy some of Mynheer
Joost's beautiful tulips.</p>



<p>So Mr. Sturteveldt had written Mynheer
Joost many letters and Mynheer Joost had
written him many letters. Finally Mr. Sturteveldt
wrote and said he very much wished his
only son Theodore to see Holland, and to become
acquainted with his Dutch relatives.
Upon this, Mynheer Joost had invited Theodore
to come and spend some time with them,
and this letter that he was now reading said that
Theodore was to sail in a few days in one of
the big steamers that sail between New York
and Rotterdam, under the care of the captain,
and requested that Mynheer Joost would make
arrangements to have him met at Rotterdam.</p>

<p>No wonder they all had to talk it over between
many sips of coffee and puffs from the
long pipes. It was a great event for the Joost
family. As for Pieter and Wilhelmina, they
could talk and think of nothing else, and Wilhelmina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
went about all the time murmuring to
herself, "How do you do?" and "I am very
pleased to see you," and "I hope you had a
pleasant voyage," so as to be sure to say it
correctly when her American cousin should
arrive.</p>

<p>"How old is Cousin Theodore, mother?"
asked Wilhelmina, as she was helping to give
the "show-room" its weekly cleaning. "Just
twelve, I believe," said her mother.</p>

<p>"And coming all by himself! I should be
frightened nearly to death," said Wilhelmina,
who was polishing the arm of a chair so hard
that the little gold ornaments on her cap bobbed
up and down.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina was short and chubby, and her
short blue dress, gathered in as full around her
waist as could be, made her look chubbier
still. Over her tight, short-sleeved bodice was
crossed a gaily flowered silk handkerchief, and
around her head, like a coronet, was a gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
band from which hung on either side a gold ornament,
which looked something like a small
corkscrew curl of gold. On top of all this she
wore a pretty little lace cap; and what was really
funny, her earrings were hung in her cap instead
of in her ears! To-day she had on a big
cotton working-apron, instead of the fine silk
one which she usually wore.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina and her mother were dressed just
alike, only Mevrouw's dress was even more
bunchy, for she had on about five heavy woollen
skirts. This is a Dutch fashion, and one wonders
how the women are able to move around
so lively.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, you are putting away another
roll of linen!" and Wilhelmina even forgot
the coming of her new cousin for the
moment, so interested was she as she saw the
mother open the great linen-press. This linen-press
was the pride of Mevrouw Joost's heart,
for piled high on its shelves were rolls and rolls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of linen, much of it made from the flax which
grew upon their place. Mevrouw Joost herself
had spun the thread on her spinning-wheel
which stood in one corner of the room, and then
it had been woven into cloth.</p>

<p>Some of these rolls of linen were more than a
hundred years old, for they had been handed
down like the china and silver. The linen of
a Dutch household is reckoned a very valuable
belonging indeed, and Wilhelmina watched her
mother smooth the big rolls which were all
neatly tied up with coloured ribbons, with a
feeling of awe, for she knew that they were a
part of their wealth, and that some day, when
she had a house of her own, some of this old
family linen would be given her, and then she,
too, would have a big linen-press of which to
be proud.</p>

<p>Just as Mevrouw Joost closed up the big
"show-room" there came a cry from the road
of "Eggs, eggs, who'll give us eggs?" "There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
come the children begging for Easter eggs,"
said Wilhelmina as she ran to the door.</p>

<p>At the gate were three little children waving
long poles on which were fastened evergreen
and flowers, and singing a queer Dutch song
about Easter eggs.</p>

<p>"May I give them some, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one each, though I think their pockets
are stuffed out with eggs, now," answered
Mevrouw.</p>

<p>But if they already did have their pockets
stuffed, the children were delighted to get the
three that Wilhelmina brought out to them,
and went on up the road, still singing, to see
how many they could get at the next house.</p>

<p>The Dutch children amuse themselves for
some days before Easter by begging for eggs
in this way, which they take to their own
homes and dye different colours and then exhibit
to their friends. On Easter Day there is
more fun, for they all gather in the meadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and roll the eggs on the grass, each trying to
hit and break those of his neighbours.</p>

<p>At last the day came when Pieter and Wilhelmina
were to see their new cousin for the
first time. Their father had gone to Rotterdam
to meet the steamship and bring Theodore
back with him.</p>

<p>The twins hurried from school, and hurried
through dinner, and in fact hurried with everything
they did. Then they put on their holiday
clothes and kept running up the road to see if
their father and Theodore were coming, although
they knew that it would be hours
before they would reach home. But of course,
just when they were not looking for them, in
walked the father and said: "Here is your
Cousin Theodore, children; make him welcome."
And there stood a tall lad, much
taller than Pieter, though they were the same
age, holding out his hand and talking English
so fast that it made their heads swim.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Pieter managed to say "How do you do?
I am glad you have come," but poor Wilhelmina&mdash;every
word of her English flew out of
her head, and all she could think to say was,
"<i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Ik dank u, mijnheer</i>,"&mdash;"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Then suddenly the children all grew as shy
as could be, but after they had eaten of Mevrouw's
good supper, they grew sociable and
Theodore told them all about his voyage over,
and Pieter found that he could understand him
better than at first. Even Wilhelmina got in a
few English words, and when Pieter and Theodore
went to sleep together, in what Theodore
called a "big box," anybody would have
thought they had known each other all their
lives.</p>

<p>The three young cousins were soon the best
of friends; and as for Theodore, everything
was so new and strange to him that he said it
was like a big surprise party all the time. He
said, too, that he was going to be a real Dutchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
while he was with them, and nothing would
do but that he must have a suit of clothes just
like Pieter's, and a tall cap. How they all
laughed the first time he tried to walk in the
big wooden shoes! But it wasn't long before
he could run in them as fast as the twins.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LAND OF DIKES AND WINDMILLS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Theodore</span> wanted to learn to speak Dutch,
and so every morning, after they had eaten
their breakfast of coffee, rye bread, and butter,
with either herrings or cheese, away he went
with the twins across the meadows to the
schoolhouse in the centre of the village.</p>

<p>After dinner Theodore and Pieter helped
about in the tulip-gardens, while Wilhelmina
and Mevrouw polished and dusted and rubbed
things, and made butter in the great wooden
and china churn.</p>

<p>On the weekly holiday the three children
would take long walks, or perhaps a ride on
the steam street-cars, or trams, which puffed
through the village; or they would ride their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bicycles, for this is a favourite pastime with
the Dutch, whose flat straight roads are always
so excellently kept.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go to-day?" asked Pieter,
as they started out for a walk one afternoon.</p>

<p>"Theodore has not seen Haarlem yet,"
said Wilhelmina. "Let's walk there and
come back on the steam-tram."</p>

<p>"That makes me feel as if I were at home.
We have a Harlem, too, which is a part of
New York City. I suppose it was named
after your city. Let's go by all means, and
I will take some pictures," said Theodore,
slinging his camera over his shoulder, and
away they went in high spirits.</p>

<p>The children were soon walking along a
shady road by the side of the canal. As far
as they could see, in any direction, stretched
the bulb-gardens blazing with colour of
all kinds. Dotted everywhere about were
windmills of all sizes, their sails gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
white in the sunlight as they went round and
round.</p>

<p>On either side of the road were neat little
villas, with trim gardens before them. As
Pieter told them, these were the summer
homes of the well-to-do people who live in
the cities. Everybody who can, has one of
these villas, where they can come during the
hot weather, and they especially like to have
one near Haarlem, because the beautiful gardens
roundabout make the country seem so
gay and bright.</p>

<p>"This is the one which belongs to Mynheer
Van der Veer," said Wilhelmina. "I
think it is the most beautiful of them all."
And so it was, according to Dutch taste. The
young people stopped to look at it admiringly.</p>

<p>For a Dutch home it was very large, because
it had two stories. The entire front was
painted in half a dozen different colours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
represent as many different coloured stones,
all arranged in a fanciful pattern.</p>

<p>The window-blinds were a bright pea-green,
and the framework a delicate pink. The door
was a dark green with a fine brass knocker in
the centre, and a brass railing, shining like
gold, ran down on either side of the white
steps. The roof was of bright red tiles, which
glistened in the sun, and what do you think
was on the highest point of the gable? A
china cat, coloured like life, and standing with
its back up, just as though it were ready to
spring upon another cat! Over the doorway
was painted the motto: "Buiten Zorg," which
means "Without a Care."</p>

<p>What really amused the party most were the
queer figures which stood around in the garden.</p>

<p>"See that funny old fellow over by the
pond, shaking his head; you might think he
was alive," said Theodore. "He looks like a
Turk with a big turban."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," said Pieter, "is an automaton,
which can be wound up so as to nod his head.
And look, there is another figure near him,&mdash;a
funny old woman, who keeps turning around,
as if she got tired of seeing the gentleman with
the turban. Those ducks swimming about on
the pond are made to move in the same way."</p>

<p>The summer villa gardens are usually filled
with these queer mechanical contrivances. I
suppose it amuses the rich old burghers to
watch them as they sit smoking their long
pipes and taking their ease in their little summer-houses
on the hot days. Mynheer Van
der Veer was very proud of his collection and
took great care of them. When a shower came
up he would put an open umbrella over each
one, which made them look funnier still, and
when it rained very hard, he would pick them
up bodily and carry them into the house; then
when the sun shone again, out would come the
funny little figures too.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why is the little summer-house in the
corner of the garden built over the canal?"
asked Theodore.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," said Pieter; "they
always are, and no villa is complete in its appointments
without one. There is where
Mynheer and Mevrouw sit in the afternoon
and have their coffee and 'koejes.' Mynheer
sits and smokes and dozes and Mevrouw does
embroidery."</p>

<p>The flower-beds were all arranged in regular
shapes; the walks were made of several kinds
of coloured sands which were arranged to form
regular patterns. The trees were not allowed
to grow as they pleased. Dear me, no! They
were trimmed in shapes and forms too, and
some of the tree-trunks were even painted.
But all was very clean and proper, and every
leaf looked as though it was frequently dusted
and washed.</p>

<p>"Well, I should not dare to move about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that garden for fear I should put something
out of order," said Theodore. "It wouldn't do
for American children to play in, with those
fine patterns in the sand and all the rest. They
would certainly disappear in a short time."</p>

<p>"So they would here, as well," laughed
Pieter. "But they are kept up only for show,
and everybody uses a side-entrance except on
grand occasions."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is a family of storks on that
house!" called out Wilhelmina; "look, Pieter,
aren't they lucky people who live there?"</p>

<p>Sure enough, on the top of the chimney
was a mass of straw, and in the midst of it stood
two tall storks. This was their nest, and Papa
and Mamma Stork were waiting for the young
Stork family to come out of their shells. Papa
Stork stood on one leg and cocked his head
down to the children as much as to say: "Don't
you wish that we were living at your house?";
for storks must know as well as anybody how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
much they are thought of in Holland. The
good people of that country build little platforms
over their chimneys just so that a stork
couple that are looking for a place to begin
housekeeping will see it and say to themselves:
"Here's a nice flat place on which to build
our nest."</p>

<p>It is considered very lucky indeed for a stork
family to come to live on one's chimney-top.</p>

<p>"We thought one was coming to live at our
house last year," said Wilhelmina, "but they
must have made up their minds to go elsewhere,
and I was so sorry."</p>

<p>"And they build on churches, too," cried
Theodore. "Look, there's a nest on the roof
of that church. I had been thinking that it
was a bundle of sticks, and wondering how
it got up there."</p>

<p>"The storks have built there for many
years, and they seem to like the highest places
they can find," said Pieter. "There is a law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to protect the storks, and to forbid any injury
being done to them, so you see they can have
a better time than most birds."</p>

<p>"Look, Pieter, there are big ships over
there in the middle of that green meadow;
how ever did they get there? Bless my stars!"
said Theodore, "I do believe they are sailing
over the grass."</p>

<p>"Oh, Theodore, you are so funny!" laughed
Wilhelmina; "of course they are on the water;
there is a canal over there where you are
looking."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see it," persisted Theodore,
who thought his eyes were playing him tricks.</p>

<p>"That's because our canals are higher than
the land about them," said Pieter. "You
must know that we are very economical with
our dry land; there is nothing we prize so
much, because we have so little of it; and
there is no people in the world who have
worked so hard for theirs as the Dutch, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
only to get it in the first place, but to keep it
afterward.</p>

<p>"Once all this country about here was either
a marsh or covered by water. The land could
not be allowed to go to waste like that, and
so great walls of mud and stone, called dikes,
were built. Canals were run here, there, and
everywhere, and the waters which covered the
lowlands were pumped into these canals and
so drained off. The new land was practically
a new area added to the small territory of Holland,
and where once was nothing but salt
marsh and water-flooded meadows are now
cities and towns and houses and lovely gardens.</p>

<p>"As one walks along many of the canal
banks in Holland, one is often overlooking
the roof-tops of the houses below."</p>

<p>"Why," said Theodore, "if we tried, we
might look right down that man's chimney,
and see what they are cooking for dinner; the
road is on a level with the roof."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, our roads, too, are often built on
dikes; this keeps them hard and dry," said
Pieter. "You may judge as to how wide some
of these dikes are, for on this particular one
there is not only a road, but a row of trees on
either side of it as well. Some are so broad
that there are houses, and even villages, on
top of them. The reclaimed lands lying
between the dikes are called 'polders,' and
thousands of acres of the richest part of Holland
have been made in this way. Some day,
too, it is planned that the whole of the Zuyder
Zee will be planted and built over with gardens
and houses."</p>

<p>"That is just like finding a country," said
Theodore, "but hasn't it all cost a lot of
money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," answered Pieter, "and not
only that, but millions of 'gulden' have still
to be spent every year to fight the waters back
again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Pieter also told Theodore that many of the
great windmills which he saw were used to
pump off the surplus water which drained
through from the canals. So many of these
canals are there in Holland that the country is
cut up by them like a checker-board. They
are of all sizes, from a tiny ditch to others big
enough for large ships to sail upon.</p>

<p>There are not only these inland dikes,
which protect the canals and the lands lying
between, but there are great sea-walls of sand
and rock to keep the sea itself in place, otherwise
it would come rushing over the lowlands
and drown half the country. Even that is not
the end of the matter. Thousands and thousands
of men have to watch these dikes day
and night, for one little leak might be the
means of flooding miles of country, and washing
away many homes and lives. When the
cry is heard, "The dike is breaking!" every
man, woman, and child must go and help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
do their share toward fighting back the
water.</p>

<p>"Well, I am proud of my Dutch blood,"
said Theodore; "they are a splendid little people
to work as they do, and they have had a
hard fight to keep their heads above water. I
wonder if that saying didn't first come from a
Dutchman!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is the reason that we Dutch
people talk so little," said Pieter; "we have to
think and work so hard all the time to keep
what we have."</p>

<p>"Well," said Theodore, "Holland is a wonderful
country; it is wholly unlike any other
place."</p>

<p>"Tell the story, Pieter," said Wilhelmina,
"of the time when the people cut the dikes
and let in the water to save themselves from
the enemy."</p>

<p>"That's a long story, and we must save it
for another time," said Pieter, "until after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Theodore has seen Leyden, for it was there
that it happened."</p>

<p>This talk on Dutch history came to a sudden
stop as Pieter called out: "Look out,
Theodore, or you will get drenched," and the
children had only time to dodge a big bucket
of water that a fat Vrouw was tossing up on her
windows. "You have not yet learned, Theodore,
that a Dutch woman will not stop her
washing and cleaning for any one," laughed
Pieter, as they left the angry Vrouw shaking
her mop at them.</p>

<p>"I have seen Vrouw Huytens, our neighbour,"
said Pieter, "scrubbing her house-front
in a heavy rain, holding an umbrella over herself
at the same time."</p>

<p>I suppose the idea of cleanliness comes from
the fact that the Dutch have so much water
handy; they say that when a Dutch Vrouw
cannot find anything else to do, she says, "Let's
wash something."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Pieter taking a picture of man with dog cart" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;I&#39;M GOING TO SNAP-SHOT ONE OF THEM WITH MY
CAMERA&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It was Saturday, the great cleaning day, and
the housewives were washing down the doors
and blinds and the sides of the houses with big
mops, until everything shone brilliantly in the
sunlight; the white door-steps, and even the
tree-trunks and the red brick walks were not forgotten.
They would dip up the water from the
canals and dash it over the pavements with a
reckless disregard for passers-by.</p>

<p>As the children entered the town matters
grew worse. Everywhere were happy Dutch
folk of all ages, swashing clean water about
over everything, until Theodore finally said:
"The next time I come out on cleaning-up
day I shall wear a waterproof. I wonder the
Dutch people don't grow web-footed, like
ducks.</p>

<p>"You don't know how strange it looks to
me to see carts drawn by dogs," he continued.
"I'm going to snap-shot one of them with my
camera."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>All along the road rattled the little carts
drawn by dogs, for dogs are used a great deal
in both Holland and Belgium in place of
horses.</p>

<p>"Don't you have them in America?" asked
Wilhelmina, in curious wonderment.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Theodore. "How people
would stare to see the baker deliver his bread
in one of our cites or towns from a little cart
drawn by dogs."</p>

<p>"Most of the vegetables from the farms
roundabout are brought into town in this way,"
said Pieter.</p>

<p>"And there is a man and a dog pulling side
by side; what would they say to that at home,
I wonder," said Theodore.</p>

<p>"Yes, some of our poor 'boers,' or farmers,
have only one dog, and he must be helped.
But there is a vegetable-cart with three fine
dogs harnessed to it. Often there are four or
five dogs to a cart," said Pieter, "and they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
draw big loads, too, I can tell you; and they
are as intelligent as human beings.</p>

<p>"You see that big black dog knows that the
brown one is not doing his share of the work,
so he keeps his eye on him and gives him a
sharp bite every once and again to keep him
up to the mark."</p>

<p>"Is that a milk-cart?" asked Theodore, as
he sighted a sort of a chariot with three great
polished brass cans in it, all shining, like everything
else that is Dutch. "See, while the
master is serving his customer, the dog just
lies down in his harness and rests; that is
where he is better off than a pony would be
under the same circumstances. Think of a
pony lying down every time he stopped."</p>

<p>At this speech of Theodore's, Wilhelmina
was much amused.</p>

<p>"A pony could not shield himself from the
sun by crawling under the cart, either," said
Pieter. "See, there is one who has crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
under his cart while he is waiting, and is taking
a comfortable nap. You may be sure, however,
if any stranger attempted to take anything
from his cart, he would become very wide
awake, and that person would be very sorry for
it, for the dogs guard their master's property
faithfully."</p>

<p>By this time our party was well into town.
They saw the "Groote Markt," or big market-place,
and the Groote Kerk. Every Dutch
town has a great market-place, and generally
the Groote Kerk, or big church, stands in it, as
well as the town hall. It is here, too, that the
principal business of the town is transacted.</p>

<p>The children walked along the canals, which
are the main streets in Dutch towns and cities,
and Theodore never grew tired of looking at
the queer houses, always with their gable ends
to the street.</p>

<p>"What on earth does that mean?" said
Theodore, stopping to read a sign on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cellar-door of a small house,&mdash;"Water and
Fire to Sell."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Pieter, "that is where the poor
people can go and buy for a tiny sum some
boiling water and a piece of red-hot peat, with
which to cook their dinner. It is really cheaper
for them than to keep a fire all the day in
their own houses. Peat is generally sold for
this purpose instead of coal or wood, for it is
not so costly."</p>

<p>By this time the young cousins were quite
ready to take the steam-tram home, and were
hungry enough for the good supper which they
knew Mevrouw Joost had prepared for them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<div class='chaptertitle'>THE KERMIS</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isn't</span> it nice that Theodore has come in
time for the Kermis?" said Wilhelmina, as
the cousins were packing the flowers into the
big baskets for the market, early one morning.</p>

<p>"What is a Kermis?" asked Theodore, all
curiosity at once.</p>

<p>"It is a great fair, and generally lasts a
week," said Pieter.</p>

<p>These fairs are held in many of the Dutch
towns and cities. Booths are put up in the
Groote Markt and on the streets, where the
sale of all kinds of things is carried on. There
are games and merrymakings, and dances, and
singing, and fancy costumes, and much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to make them novel to even the Dutch themselves.</p>

<p>"There is to be a Kermis at Rotterdam
shortly," said Pieter, "and the father has
promised to take us all."</p>

<p>For a time the children talked about nothing
but the Kermis, until at last the great day
came, and they all found themselves on the
train which was taking them to Rotterdam.</p>

<p>As they drew near the city it was easy to
see that everybody was going to the Kermis,
and was thinking of nothing else. The roads
were crowded with all kinds of queer vehicles
and gay costumes. There were the big country
wagons, of strange shapes, and painted in
bright colours. In them were piled the whole
family,&mdash;grandparents, mother, father, aunts,
uncles, and cousins. There were the dogs,
too, drawing their little carts, and trying to
keep up with the big wagons, panting bravely
along with their tongues hanging out, as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as to say, "We are not going to let the horses
get there first, just because we are little."</p>

<p>There were men and women on bicycles,&mdash;the
women with their caps and streamers flapping
in the wind like white wings, and their
half-dozen skirts filling out like a balloon, as
they pedalled rapidly along.</p>

<p>It was just twelve o'clock as our party left
the station, and the bells were ringing gaily,
which was the signal for the opening of the
Kermis.</p>

<p>"My, but isn't this a jam!" gasped Theodore,
who found himself wedged in between
the market-baskets of two fat Vrouws.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," said Mynheer Joost, "and
we must not lose sight of one another. Now,
Wilhelmina, you keep between Theodore and
Pieter, while the mother and I will go ahead
to open the way."</p>

<p>There was no use trying to hurry,&mdash;Dutch
folk do not hurry, even to a Kermis,&mdash;so our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
party just let themselves be pushed slowly
along until they reached the Groote Markt.</p>

<p>Here things were really getting lively. All
around the great square were booths or stalls,
where one could buy almost anything they were
likely to want. Flags were flying everywhere,
and from booth to booth were stretched garlands
of flowers and streamers of ribbons. In
the centre of the market-square a band of music
was playing, and couples were trying to dance
in spite of the rough cobblestone pavement
and the jostling of the crowd which was watching
them.</p>

<p>"You can see now, Theodore, just how
your Dutch cousins really look, for there are
folk here from all over the country, and all in
their best holiday dress," said Mynheer Joost.
"That group of little girls, with those high
sleeves that come nearly to the tops of their
heads, and with extra large skirts, are from Zealand."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see a woman with two or three caps on
her head, and a big, black straw hat on top of
them," said Theodore.</p>

<p>"She is from Hindeloopen; and there, too,
are a number of fisherwomen, wearing huge
straw hats, which look like big baskets."</p>

<p>There were other women wearing beautiful
flowered silk shawls, and the sun glistened on
the gold ornaments which dangled from their
white caps as their owners danced up and
down between the long lines of booths, holding
each other's hands.</p>

<p>People were already crowding around the
booths, buying their favourite dainties to eat,
which at once reminded the young people that
they, too, were hungry.</p>

<p>"What will you have, Theodore, 'poffertjes'
or 'oliebollen'?" asked Pieter.</p>

<p>"Oh, what names!" laughed Theodore.
"How can I tell? Show them to me first."</p>

<p>"Of course Theodore must eat the 'poffertjes,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
for that is the real Kermis cake," said
Mynheer Joost, and led the way to a booth
where a woman with a big, flapping cap and
short sleeves was standing, dipping ladlefuls
of batter from a big wooden bowl, and dropping
them into hollowed-out places in a big pan,
which was placed on an open fire before
her.</p>

<p>As soon as they were cooked, another woman
piled them nicely up, one on top of another,
with butter and sugar between, and, with a
smile, set a big plateful before the children,
who made them disappear in short order.</p>

<p>"Why, they are buckwheat cakes, just like
ours at home!" said Theodore, in the midst of
his first mouthful; "and they are fine, too.
Now let us try the other thing with the funny
name," he continued.</p>

<p>"There they are, in that box," said Pieter,
as he pointed to some fritters, made in the
shape of little round balls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, 'oliebollen' aren't half so nice as
waffles; let us have them instead," said Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>"I think I agree with Wilhelmina," said
Theodore; "the 'oliebollen' seem to be taking
a bath in oil," he continued, shaking his
head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, try one, anyhow," said Pieter. "You
must not miss any of the Kermis cakes."</p>

<p>"Well, they taste better than they look,"
said Theodore, as he swallowed one of the
greasy little balls.</p>

<p>"How would you like a raw herring, now,
to give you an appetite for your dinner?"
asked Pieter, as they passed the fish-stalls,
which were decorated with festoons of fish that
looked, at a little distance, like strings of white
flags waving in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Not for me, thank you," answered his
cousin, "but just look at all those people eating
them as if they enjoyed them; and dried fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and smoked fish, too, and all without any
bread."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="332" height="500" alt="Crowd of people filling street" />
<span class="caption">AT THE KERMIS</span>
</div>

<p>After the waffles had been found and eaten,
the young people became much interested in
watching a group of men trying to break a
cake. The cake was placed over a hollowed-out
place in a large log of wood, and whoever
could break the cake in halves with a blow of
his stick won the cake, or what was left of it.
The thing sounds easy, but it proved more difficult
than would have seemed possible.</p>

<p>"Let us eat an 'ellekoek' together, Pieter;
there they are," and Wilhelmina pointed to
what looked like yards and yards of ribbon
hanging from one of the booths. The children
forthwith bought a length, which was measured
off for them just as if it really were ribbon, and
Wilhelmina put one end in her mouth and
Pieter the other end in his. The idea is to eat
this ribbon cake without touching it with the
hands or without its breaking. This Wilhelmina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Pieter managed to do in spite of
much laughter, and gave each other a hearty
kiss when they got to the middle of it.</p>

<p>"Well," said Theodore, "I should think
that a Kermis was for the purpose of eating
cakes."</p>

<p>The market-place became gayer and gayer.
A crowd of people would lock arms and form
a long line, and then go skipping and dancing
along between the booths, singing and trying
to capture other merrymakers in order to
make them join their band.</p>

<p>"Look out, Theodore, or this line will catch
you," laughed Pieter, who jumped out of the
way, pulling Wilhelmina after him.</p>

<p>The first thing Theodore knew, a gay crowd
had circled around him and made him a prisoner,
calling out to him to come and keep
Kermis with them. But Theodore was not to
be captured so easily; he had not become proficient
in gymnastics for nothing, so he simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ran up to a short little fellow, and putting his
hands on his shoulders, vaulted clean over
him, to the amazement of the crowd and the
delight of the twins.</p>

<p>The fun lasted long into the night, but
Mynheer Joost took his little party to their
hotel early in the evening, for the fun was
growing somewhat boisterous; besides, they
had a long day ahead of them for the morrow.</p>

<p>Mevrouw and Jan were going back by the
train, but Mynheer and the children had
brought their bicycles with them, and were
going to cycle back a part of the way. The
children were looking forward to this with as
much pleasure as they had to any feature of
the Kermis. And so they went to bed and
dreamed of cakes, miles long, that wiggled
about like long snakes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BICYCLE RIDE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Be</span> up bright and early," Mynheer Joost
had said the night before, and it was a little
after seven when the young people finished
breakfast. A Dutch breakfast is a big thing;
besides nice coffee, there was rye bread and
and white bread, rolls and rusks, half a dozen
kinds of cheeses, as well as many kinds of cold
sausages cut into thin slices.</p>

<p>After seeing Mevrouw and Jan off on the
train, the children mounted their wheels, and,
in company with Mynheer, went bumping over
the big round cobblestones with which Rotterdam
is paved.</p>

<p>"Our city streets are not as good as our
country roads, but we will soon be out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
open country," said Mynheer, as they turned
into the "Boompjes."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Theodore," he continued,
"your steamer landed you just at that
dock opposite."</p>

<p>The "Boompjes" is a great quay alongside
of which are to be seen all manner of steamships,
from those which trade with the ports of
Great Britain and Germany, to the little craft
which ply up and down the rivers and canals
of Holland, and the long barges and canal-boats
with their brown sails.</p>

<p>Our bicycle party crossed many bridges over
little and big canals. By the side of many of
these canals the great tall houses seemed to
grow right up out of the water, queer old
houses with gables all twists and curves. At
last they passed through the "Delftsche Poort,"
one of the old gateways of Rotterdam, and then
out on to the smooth country road, still running
by the side of the canal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, this is better," said Pieter, as he gave
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"No wonder cycling is popular in Holland;
you have such fine, flat roads," said Theodore.
"Just look at this one all paved with tiny
bricks; why, it's like riding on a table-top."</p>

<p>"They are called 'klinkers,' and many of
our roads are paved this way; but do you see
that town just to the left, Theodore?" said
Mynheer Joost, as he pointed to a jumble of
houses, windmills, and masts of ships not far
away. "That is Delfshaven; you know what
happened there once long ago, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was from there that the Pilgrim
Fathers sailed for America," cried Theodore.</p>

<p>"But I thought they sailed from Plymouth,
England," said Pieter.</p>

<p>"They did put into Plymouth, on account
of a storm, but their first start was from Delfshaven.
Can't we go and see the place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
they went on board ship, Cousin Joost?" said
Theodore, who nearly tumbled off his wheel
in his effort to see the town.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="330" height="500" alt="walking beside a dyke beside windmills" />
<span class="caption">ON THE ROAD TO DELFSHAVEN</span>
</div>

<p>"I am afraid the spot could not be found
now," smiled Mynheer. "Delfshaven has
grown to be a big town since then; but you
can see the church where they worshipped before
they set sail."</p>

<p>So they turned on to the road into the
town. The old church seemed plain and bare
to Theodore, as he stood in it and looked at
its simple white walls, and it was hard for him
to realize that the history of New England
began here.</p>

<p>"I must write Henry all about Delfshaven;
he'd give a lot to be in my shoes, now," said
Theodore, as they rode away again.</p>

<p>"Who is Henry?" asked Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>"He is a chum of mine and lives in Boston.
You see his people came over with the
Pilgrims, just as mine came over later from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Holland, and he is always talking a lot about
the <i>Mayflower</i> and all that.</p>

<p>"But just see that woman pulling that big
boat, and the two children helping her&mdash;think
of it!" and Theodore forgot all about
the Pilgrims in the strange sight before
him.</p>

<p>"Those are barge-people; let us stop and
rest awhile, and you can see them better,"
said Mynheer, who set the example by jumping
off his wheel.</p>

<p>It did look like hard work, too, as the
woman came slowly along, panting and straining
at one end of a long rope. There was a
loop in the rope which passed over her chest,
and the other end was made fast to the prow
of the barge, or "tjalk." Behind her were a
little girl and a boy, not more than ten or
twelve years old, each of them, like the mother,
tugging away at the heavy load.</p>

<p>"Think of those little children helping to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
move that great heavy boat! I don't see how
they do it," said Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>"It must be hard work, but they don't
seem to mind it," said her father.</p>

<p>It looked as if the children did not, for they
were plump and round, and as they passed,
they smiled shyly and said "Good morning,"
and kept looking back with grins of amusement.</p>

<p>"The father is the one who has the easy
time," said Pieter; "see, he sits comfortably
beside the big tiller, to which he only gives
a slight turn once and again, for the canals
are so straight that the 'tjalk' does not
require much steering. He is quite content
to let the Vrouw and the little ones tow the
'tjalk' while he smokes and dozes on
deck."</p>

<p>"Well, it grows 'curiouser and curiouser,'
as Alice in Wonderland said. Your roads are
of water, and your wagons are boats, and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
people do the work of horses. Why don't they
use horses?" demanded Theodore.</p>

<p>"Well the 'tjalks' really depend upon the
wind to carry them along," said Mynheer.
"You see this one has a big sail, and it is only
when there is no wind that they have to tow
the boats. Once they used dogs for the towing,
but now the people who live on board do
the work, and if it is slow, why, nobody seems
to mind."</p>

<p>The barge was painted red and blue, and in
the great rounded bow there were two round
openings through which the anchor-chains
passed, and which looked like big staring eyes,
particularly at night, when a ray of light often
shot through them.</p>

<p>"Of course some one is washing things, as
usual," said Theodore; "even the barges don't
escape a continual 'spring cleaning.' And
sure enough, there was another woman splashing
pailfuls of water over everything, even over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the drowsy Mynheer at the tiller. He was
probably used to this, however, for he didn't
take the slightest notice.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, the 'tjalk' owners take a
great pride in the spick and span appearance
of their boats," said Mynheer Joost. "You
must remember that the 'tjalk' is their home.
They are born on it, and often live and die
there, as did their fathers and grandfathers
before them, for many of these boats are very
old. The little cabin on the poop is all the
house they ever have, and they are just as
proud of it as if it were a fine villa like that
of Mynheer Van der Veer.</p>

<p>"You see," he continued, "they have their
little garden, too. There are tulips planted in
a box before the door, and a tiny path outlined
with shells."</p>

<p>"And a little garden-gate, too," cried Wilhelmina;
"isn't it funny?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, "they like to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that they have everything that goes with a
house on land."</p>

<p>"There is a cage of birds, also," said Wilhelmina
again, "and a little china dog sitting by
the side of the tulip-bed, who seems to be
watching them."</p>

<p>"I suppose if there were room enough in
the garden there would be a summer-house,
too," said Pieter.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what the "bargees"
enjoy their lives, and nothing would make
them so unhappy as to have to live on dry
land. There are thousands and thousands
of these "tjalks" in Holland, and most
of the merchandise of all kinds which is
transported about the country is carried by
them.</p>

<p>"Time to be on the road," said Mynheer to
his young party; and before long they were all
riding into the old town of Delft.</p>

<p>"Listen to those bells," cried Theodore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"they are playing one of our popular American
marches. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Those are the chimes you hear ringing in
the belfry," said Pieter. "They must be playing
the march in your honour, Theodore."</p>

<p>Each town in Holland has its chime of bells,
usually hung in the tower of the principal
church. The chimes are played by means of a
wonderful mechanical keyboard, and the Dutch
are very fond of hearing them ring out the
popular tunes of the day.</p>

<p>"It was in this place that long ago the
famous blue and white Delftware was made,
like that the mother has at home," said Mynheer.
"There is Delftware made now, but it is
not prized like the old kind.</p>

<p>"But we must not linger, children, if we are
to reach The Hague for dinner," and he marshalled
the young people again upon the road.</p>

<p>Soon they were skimming over the smooth,
flat roadway, and came almost at once on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
fine boulevards lined with handsome houses,
so they knew they were at The Hague
itself.</p>

<p>The twins were as interested as their American
cousin in the sights of their capital city,
and Wilhelmina wanted to know at once if there
would be a chance of their seeing the queen.
You see she was named after Queen Wilhelmina,
so she felt as if she had a right to see
her, even more than other little Dutch girls,
though indeed they are all fond of their young
ruler, who not so very long ago was a young
girl like Wilhelmina herself.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina had among her treasures at home
a picture of Queen Wilhelmina, taken when
she was a little girl, and dressed in the pretty
Frisian costume, one of the prettiest of the
national costumes of Holland.</p>

<p>"I can't say," smiled her father, in answer
to Wilhelmina's question, "but we can go out
to the 'Huis ten Bosch,' and maybe we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be fortunate enough to meet her out driving in
the park."</p>

<p>After our friends had done justice to a good
dinner at one of the famous hotels of The
Hague, they left their bicycles at the hotel,
and took the steam-tram to the "Huis ten
Bosch," which is Dutch for "House in the
Wood." It is one of the royal palaces of Holland
and is situated in the midst of a beautiful
wood. The forests of Holland are very much
prized because there are so few of them, and
so this "House in the Wood" is one of the
favourite royal residences.</p>

<p>Though Wilhelmina did not see her queen,
she saw the next best thing, for they went
through the state apartments of the palace, and
saw the beautiful Chinese Room and the Japanese
Room, each of them entirely filled with
beautiful things from the Orient.</p>

<p>"Now shall we go to Scheveningen, or are
you too tired?" asked Mynheer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tired!" The children laughed at the
idea. They were out for a holiday, and were
going to see as much as possible; and away
they went again on another steam-tram to a
fishing-town a few miles from The Hague,
called Scheveningen, which is a big mouthful
of a word, isn't it? This is where the fisherfolk
live who go out in their stubby boats,
called "pinken," to fish in the North Sea.</p>

<p>"I don't see the ocean," said Pieter, looking
about him as they walked through the
town, with its rows and rows of neat little
houses of brick where the fishermen live.</p>

<p>"Climb up to the top of those sand-dunes
and you will," said his father. "These dunes
or banks of sand have been blown up by the
wind and sea until they form a high wall or
breakwater. There are many such all along
the coast of Holland, and to keep the wind
from blowing the loose sand back inland, over
the fields and gardens, these banks of sand, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dunes, are planted over in many places with
grasses and shrubs, which bind the sand together
and keep it in place."</p>

<p>"There is a fish auction going on over
there: let's go down and see it," called out
Pieter.</p>

<p>A boat-load of fish had just been landed on
the beach, and a crowd of fishermen and women
were standing around it. The women had
big basket-shaped hats over their white caps,
and the men wore baggy trousers and tall
caps.</p>

<p>The fish were being auctioned off in the
Dutch fashion, which is just the reverse of the
usual auctioneering methods. A market price
is put upon the fish, and the purchaser bidding
the nearest thereto takes them.</p>

<p>"What are those things on the sands over
there that look like big mushrooms, Cousin
Joost?" asked Theodore, pointing to a spot
half a mile or so farther on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"They do look something like mushrooms,
Theodore," said his uncle, "and they come
and go about as quickly. They are the
straw chairs and shelters in which visitors sit
when they are taking the fresh air on the
sands."</p>

<p>These chairs are closed in on all sides but
one, and have a sort of roof over them, so as
to protect the occupant from the wind and
rain. Scheveningen, besides being one of the
largest fishing-towns in Holland, is the great
seaside resort of the Dutch people. Here the
well-to-do burghers and merchants come with
their Vrouws and sit in the big basket-chairs,
while the children dig miniature canals and
build toy dikes in the sand, modelled after
those which surround their homes.</p>

<p>When our tourists got back to The Hague
they walked around and looked at the fine
houses of the city. They saw, too, the storks
in the market-place, around which were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fisherwomen with their wares spread out for
sale. The storks are well fed, and are kept
here at the expense of the city, for good luck,
perhaps.</p>

<p>The children thought they had cycled quite
enough for one day, so they put their wheels
and themselves in the train for Leyden, and
were soon tooting into one of the oldest cities
of Holland.</p>

<p>"Are we there already?" asked Theodore,
amazed at the shortness of the journey.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything is close together in our
little Holland," said Mynheer.</p>

<p>The Dutch are very proud of Leyden for
many reasons, but especially for the brave
defence the city made against the Spaniards at
the time when the sturdy Dutch were fighting
to free themselves from the rule of Spain.
The city was besieged for nearly a year, but
the plucky burghers never gave in. The city
was finally saved by cutting the dikes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
letting in the waters, so that the Dutch fleet
could sail right up to the city walls and thus
drive off the enemy. It is said that to reward
the people of Leyden for their bravery and
courage, the government afterward offered to
either free them forever from all taxes, or to
give them a university. They wisely chose
the latter, and this same University of Leyden
has always ranked among the great institutions
of learning throughout the world, and many
great men have studied within its walls.</p>

<p>"Your friend Henry would like to see
Leyden, also," said Mynheer. "It was here
that the Pilgrim Fathers lived for many years
before they finally set sail for the New World.
The city gave them a safe shelter, when they
were persecuted and driven from other lands,
and for this reason alone Leyden should
always be remembered by our American
cousins."</p>

<p>"Don't you feel as if you had been up two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
whole days?" asked Theodore of Pieter, as
he gave a big yawn; but Pieter and Wilhelmina
were already fast asleep as the train
whirled them on toward Haarlem.</p>

<p>None of the children talked much either
while they ate the hot supper Mevrouw
Joost had ready for them, and soon they
were tucked away in their beds. But the
next day you should have heard the three
tongues wag, and Mevrouw and Baby Jan
had to hear all the adventures over again
many times.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHERE THE CHEESES COME FROM</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> a jumble of ships and houses! I
shouldn't think you would know whether you
were going into a house or aboard ship, when
you open the front door," said Theodore, one
fine summer's day, when the cousins were
strolling about Amsterdam, on their way to
pay the promised visit to Mynheer Van
der Veer.</p>

<p>Others besides Theodore might think the
same thing, for Amsterdam really grew up
out of the water. The houses are, for the
most part, built on wooden piles; and there
are as many canals as there are streets, and
big ships move about between the buildings in
the most wonderful manner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>They found Mynheer Van der Veer smoking
his meerschaum pipe at his warehouse on
one of the principal canals. He was glad indeed
to see his little friends of the tulip-garden,
as he called them, and showed them
all around the big establishment. They saw
the big ships that were anchored right at his
door, and the bales and boxes being loaded
into their holds from the very windows of the
warehouse itself. He showed them the coffees
and sugars and spices which other ships had
brought from the Dutch East Indies, which as
you all know are around on the other side of
the world. Holland owns some of the richest
islands in the world, many of them larger than
Holland itself. One of these islands is Java,
where the fine Java coffee comes from, and
this is one of the reasons why the Dutch always
have such good coffee, and drink so much
of it.</p>

<p>Mynheer gave them all nice spices to taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and was amused at the faces they made at
some hot peppery things they were eager
to try.</p>

<p>After this he took them to his fine, tall
house that faced on another canal, where there
were long rows of other tall houses, all built of
tiny bricks and as neat as pins. All of them
were as much alike, in their outside appearance
at least, as a row of pins, too. Here the
children met the portly Mevrouw Van der
Veer in her rustling silk dress, who gave them
a warm welcome.</p>

<p>She had just come in from a walk, and on the
top of her beautiful lace cap with its gold ornaments
she wore a very fashionable modern
hat.</p>

<p>"Oh," thought Wilhelmina, "why does she
spoil her fine cap like that?" But you see
many Dutch ladies who combine the old and
the new styles in just that way.</p>

<p>They all sat in Mevrouw's fine parlour, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
its shining waxed floor, which was filled with
beautiful things from all parts of the world.
There was furniture of teak-wood from India,
wonderfully carved, and rare china and porcelain
from China and Japan. Exquisite silk
curtains hung at the windows, and embroidered
screens cut off any possible draughts.</p>

<p>These rare things had been brought from
time to time in Mynheer's ships, as they were
homeward bound from these far-off countries.</p>

<p>Mevrouw sat before a little table laden with
silver and fine china, and poured coffee for
them from a big silver coffee-pot, and gave
them many kinds of nice Dutch cakes to eat;
and when she said good-bye she promised Mynheer
Joost that she would come some day and
see his tulip-garden herself.</p>

<p>"Why was that small looking-glass fastened
outside of one of the upper windows?" asked
Theodore, as they left Mynheer Van der Veer's
house.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many of these Dutch houses have these
little mirrors fastened before the windows at
such an angle that by merely looking in it from
the inside, one may see who is at the front
door," said his cousin; "and then, too, the
ladies can sit by the window, sewing or reading,
and can amuse themselves by watching what is
going on in the street below, without troubling
to look out of the window."</p>

<p>"I should hate to have to wear a dress like
that," said Wilhelmina, looking at two young
girls who were passing by. It did look strange,
for one half of their dress was red and the other
half black.</p>

<p>"They are the girls from the orphanage, and
this is the uniform that they all must wear,"
said Mynheer Joost.</p>

<p>"Now Theodore must see some of the pictures
of our great painters," he continued, as he
led the young folks toward the splendid picture-gallery,
where they strolled through what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
seemed to them miles of rooms and corridors,
all hung with beautiful and valuable pictures,
for little Holland has had some of the greatest
artists the world has ever known, and some
day, if you care about pictures,&mdash;and you certainly
should,&mdash;you will want to go there and
see them for yourself.</p>

<p>After this they did a great deal more sight-seeing,
and Mynheer showed them the "Exchange,"
where the business of the city is
carried on, and told them that there was one
week in the year when the boys of Amsterdam
were allowed to use the "Exchange" for a
playground.</p>

<p>This was a reward for the good deed of some
brave boys of long ago, when the Spaniards
were plotting to capture the city. The boys,
it seems, first discovered the secret, and
went and informed the authorities, who were
thus able to defend their city from attack.</p>

<p>"This," said Mynheer, "was the case when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I was young, and I suppose the boys are still
allowed the same privilege."</p>

<p>Our little folk were glad enough to take their
seats on the deck of the little steamboat which
was to take them to Alkmaar, the centre of
the cheese-trade of North Holland.</p>

<p>"Whew! but we have done a lot of tramping
about to-day; oh, my poor feet!" said Pieter,
as he stretched himself out on a bench.</p>

<p>"Father, haven't you got something for us to
eat in your pocket?" asked Wilhelmina, coaxingly.</p>

<p>Mynheer smiled, and from away down in
the depths of his pocket, he drew forth a big
loaf of gingerbread. The children munched
away at this favourite Dutch delicacy, and
amused themselves by watching the people
who were making the journey with them.</p>

<p>There were two fat old women, sitting side
by side and knitting away as if for their lives.
They nodded their heads every time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
spoke, which made their long gold corkscrew
ornaments in their caps bob up and down, and
each had her feet on a little foot-stove as if it
were midwinter. There were two little girls
with their father, who looked like little dolls,
in short red dresses, with dark green waists and
short sleeves, and pretty aprons embroidered
in many coloured silks, and many gold chains,
and earrings reaching nearly down to their
shoulders. They had a solid gold head-piece
under their caps. The man had on velvet
knickerbockers, nearly as broad as they were
long, and two great silver rosettes fastened in
his belt. There were big silver buttons on his
jacket, and his cap must have been over a foot
high.</p>

<p>The little girls were very shy, but when
Wilhelmina offered them some of her gingerbread
they soon made friends, and the three
were soon chatting away like old acquaintances.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aren't they gorgeous?" whispered Pieter.
"They are from the little island of Marken,
near here, in the Zuyder Zee, and have on
all their holiday clothes."</p>

<p>The island of Marken is like a big bowl,
Mynheer told them, for all of it but the rim is
lower than the waters which surround it. The
rim is a high stone wall which was built to
keep the water out. Everybody who lives
there keeps a boat tied to their gate or door in
order that they may have some means of
escape if the wall should ever break.</p>

<p>"Just think of it! I should never sleep
nights, if I lived there, for fear of waking up
and finding myself floating about in the water.
I should think the Dutch would be the most
nervous people in the world, instead of the
most placid," said Theodore.</p>

<p>"That danger does not often happen," said
Mynheer. "But look how beautifully carved
their shoes are. The men do it themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
during the long winter evenings, and take great
pride in their work."</p>

<p>The little steamer puffed along the North
Sea Canal, by which the big ships come right
up to Amsterdam. All kinds of queer tublike
boats, with big brown sails, tanned to preserve
them from the damp, passed them, and soon
they turned into the river Zaan.</p>

<p>"There is Zaandam," said Mynheer; "they
say that most of the people who live there are
millionaires. It is a wealthy little town."</p>

<p>"You would not think so from the looks
of the houses," remarked Pieter; "they seem
mostly to be small brick cottages of one story,
with a tiny yard in front."</p>

<p>As the steamer glides along, between green
meadows as flat as one's hand, they could see
on all sides innumerable windmills. The boys
tried to count them, but soon gave up the task.
It is said that there are over six hundred of
them in this one short stretch of country.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are some of the windmills built on
top of the houses?" asked Theodore.</p>

<p>"For the reason that they are made to turn
the machinery which is situated in the buildings
below," said Mynheer; "not all the windmills
are used for pumping water, by any
means."</p>

<p>They were now in the midst of the cheese
country, one of the richest sections of Holland.
There were everywhere to be seen trim little
villas and neat farmhouses, while the meadows
were full of the curiously marked black and
white cows called "Holsteins." These are the
favourite cows throughout Holland for furnishing
the milk for the famous butter and cheeses
of the country.</p>

<p>They were at Alkmaar before they knew it.
The two old women, who had never stopped
knitting for a moment, picked up their little
foot-stoves and waddled off; Wilhelmina bade
her little Marken friends good-bye; and Mynheer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
party hurried off to a little inn on the
market-place, for the sun was setting and the
children said they were nearly starved, in spite
of the gingerbread which they had eaten.</p>

<p>Outside the inn was a row of fat, sleepy-looking
old men sitting on a long bench,
watching a game of "skittles" which was
going on in the square, for both "grown-ups"
and children usually play their games in the
village square. Each had his long pipe and a
glass of "schnapps" just under his part of the
bench, and when he wanted a drink all he had
to do was to reach down and get it. Not one
of them said a word; they just sat there and
looked, and smoked and drank.</p>

<p>In a cosy room, with a floor of red bricks,
neatly covered with sand, a rosy-cheeked girl
soon set out a real Dutch supper for our
hungry little travellers.</p>

<p>There was cold sausage, potato salad, fresh
herrings, and a strange dish made of buttermilk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and buckwheat-flour, all boiled together and
flavoured with green herbs. The Joost family
thought it delicious, but Theodore said that
it would take him some time to get used to it,
and preferred the big loaves of rye-bread filled
with raisins. As for cheeses, there was no end
to the different kinds&mdash;and all of them excellent;
while to wind up with, there was a
delicious hot gingerbread and good coffee.
Did it keep them awake? No, indeed, they
dropped off to sleep in a moment, inside their
big cupboard-beds, that had doors to them,
instead of curtains, which made them look
more like boxes than ever.</p>

<p>"Just come and look out the window,
Theodore," said Pieter early the next morning.
He was at the window and Theodore was out
of bed in a moment and beside him.</p>

<p>"Why the whole square is filled with
cheeses," he cried. So it was, for this was
market-day, when the farmers&mdash;"boeren,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they are called&mdash;from all the country roundabout
bring in their cheeses to sell them in
the market-place.</p>

<p>The boys scrambled into their clothes, and
in a few minutes were walking among the
great piles of cheeses. There were all kinds
and shapes and sizes,&mdash;cheeses that looked like
great red balls, yellow cheeses, white cheeses,
green cheeses, flat, round, square and all sizes.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose there were as many
cheeses in the world," said Theodore, looking
around him. "And the wagons, too, aren't
they fine; they look as gay as circus wagons."</p>

<p>And so they did, for they were painted
every colour under the sun; some of them
even had flowers painted upon them; and
they were all shapes, too; some were curved
like shells, and others looked not unlike a boat
on wheels.</p>

<p>"Let us see what is going on over there,
where there is such a crowd of people," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Pieter, as he led the way to the other side of
the square.</p>

<p>Here was the Weighing-House, where the
cheeses were being weighed on funny old-fashioned
scales, which looked as though they had
been in use hundreds of years. The buyers,
too, were testing the cheeses. They would
taste a cheese and cut a small plug out of it to
see if it were of good quality, and then they
would put the plug back in place again, when
the cheese, to all appearances, looked as it did
before.</p>

<p>The bargaining over the cheeses took a long
time, for the farmers are very careful to make
a good deal for themselves, and they will not
be hurried; and generally, when they are on
their way home again, they look very well satisfied
with themselves, and as contented as the
portly Vrouw sitting beside them, or the
"kinder," as they call the children, playing
about in the bottom of the wagon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't suppose you boys have given up
eating breakfast," a voice behind them said,
and turning they saw Mynheer Joost.</p>

<p>"Wilhelmina and I have already had ours,
so hurry up with yours, and then come down
to the canal; we are going to see the cheeses
loaded on to the boats."</p>

<p>Along the canal were drawn up the boats,
with their brown sails, and steamers and barges
and all kinds of craft. When the boys appeared
again, they all stopped to watch a
pile of round, red cheeses which were piled up
like shot, ready to be loaded.</p>

<p>A man picked one up in either hand and
tossed them to another man, who was standing
beside the ship's hatch; and he, in turn, tossed
them to another who was down in the hold
and who was stacking them up in neat rows.</p>

<p>"I'd like to play that kind of ball; it looks
as easy as can be," said Pieter.</p>

<p>"It's not as easy as you think," said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
father; "just pick up one of these cheeses, and
try its weight."</p>

<p>Pieter tried and so did Theodore; but they
thought better of it as a game, and the cheese
man himself laughed at their unsuccessful efforts
to grasp a cheese in one hand.</p>

<p>"Just look at our hands," exclaimed Theodore,
after they had finished handling the
cheeses; "they are quite red."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="Man pulling a boat with a rope across his chest" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE CHILDREN STOOD IN THE BOWS&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"That is the red colouring matter which is
put on the outside to preserve them," said
Mynheer.</p>

<p>"Now we will take a walk around the town,
and then make our way back to Amsterdam,"
said Mynheer Joost; "and we will stop by
the way at Edam, and you can see the little
town which gives the name to these red
cheeses."</p>

<p>During the dinner at Edam, a happy idea
struck Mynheer Joost. "Children," he said,
"how would you like to have a ride in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
'trekschuit,' or passenger barge? There is
one leaving here for Volendam in half an hour,
the landlord of the inn tells me, and if you are
ready, we will go out and hunt it up."</p>



<p>"Oh, that will be great fun," cried the twins
in one breath.</p>

<p>There are few of these old-time conveyances
left in Holland, and it was as much a novelty
for them as for Theodore.</p>

<p>You will see from the picture what an odd
sort of a passenger craft the "trekschuit" really
is. There is one man pulling it, while another
walks behind and steers it by the big tiller,
which he handles from the shore in the same
manner that he would if he were on board.</p>

<p>The children stood in the bows among the
big brass milk-cans and butter baskets of the
market-women, and said they knew just how
comfortable the fat Dutchmen feel, as they sit
on their "tjalks," and let their women and
children draw them about.</p>

<p>The next day found our little friends home
again, planning other good times.</p>

<p>Soon the time came, however, when Theodore
must leave his Dutch cousins and go back
to America. The twins were nearly broken-hearted
at the very idea of it; for they had
become as fond of Theodore as if he were a
brother. Wilhelmina wept, and said she didn't
see why Theodore could not stay for St. Nicholas;
and Pieter himself had to wink hard to
keep back the tears.</p>

<p>But Theodore consoled them by telling them
that he would come again and spend a winter
with them, so as to see a real Dutch Christmas,
which, strange to say, is celebrated on the feast
of good St. Nicholas, which comes on the sixth
of December. Then they would have skating
and all kinds of winter sports together, which,
to tell the truth, are the favourite amusements
of our little Dutch cousins.</p>
